    <h2>Didn't receive a code?</h2>
    <p>In case you did not receive a code, this can be due to the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The SMS service is (temporarily) unavailable, so the code could not be sent.</li>
        <li>The mail service is (temporarily) unavailable, so the code could not be sent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the problem persists, consult your administrator.

    <p>
        If you have forgotten your personal pin code, you can log in again with username and password.
        You can then create a new pin code via the account menu. Do you want to log in with username and
        password?
